        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Hope for Orphans is dedicated to providing shelter, education, and emotional support to orphaned children worldwide. We believe every child deserves the opportunity to live a full and meaningful life, and our mission is to make that possible for orphans.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where no orphan is left behind, where every child has access to love, care, and a quality education. We strive to provide holistic care that nurtures not only the physical needs of children but also their emotional well-being.</p>

        <h2>Our Programs</h2>
        <p>We run several key programs designed to support orphans:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Orphanage Support:</strong> We provide funding and resources to orphanages to improve living conditions, healthcare, and education.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Sponsorship:</strong> We sponsor orphans' education, providing books, uniforms, and tuition fees to ensure they receive quality education.</li>
            <li><strong>Mentorship Programs:</strong> We connect orphans with mentors who guide them in building life skills and preparing for their futures.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare and Emotional Support:</strong> We offer medical care and counseling to address both physical and emotional needs.</li>
